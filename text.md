### Explanation

This simple LSTM model was trained on a collection of poems : "Les Fleurs du Mal" by Charles Baudelaire a french poet. You can input as many words as you want and the model predicts the following 50 words.

This model is not perfect but still manages to write coherent sentences, especially for the beginning words. As we add more words, the following words make less and less sense.

The notebook used for training can be found in our github repo.
